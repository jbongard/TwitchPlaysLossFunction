Hypothesis: A crowd can create more perverse-instantiation resistant objective functions (PIROF) than lone experts can.

## Experimental design

1. Double blind study.

2. Experts and non-experts submit objective functions via chat in Twitch.

3. Non-experts are shown robots evolved against both sets of functions.

4. If non-experts prefer those evolved using non-expert objective functions, this supports the hypothesis.

## Interface design

1. Users type equations into chat.

2. Equations manipulate matrices, but must ultimate result in a scalar.

3. Matrices are visualized as heatmaps.

4. Sensor data is visualized in the 'root' matrix.

5. The robot's body parts are colorized; sensor columns are shown in matching colors.
