Hypothesis: A crowd can create more perverse-instantiation resistant objective functions (PIROF) than lone experts can.

## Experimental design

To be determined.

## Interface design

1. Users type equations into chat.

2. Equations manipulate matrices, but must ultimate result in a scalar.

3. Matrices are visualized as heatmaps.

4. Sensor data is visualized in the 'root' matrix.

5. The robot's body parts are colorized; sensor columns are shown in matching colors.
